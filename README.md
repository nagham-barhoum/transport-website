# Transport Website — PDF & Email / Visit-Log Demo

A simple Laravel-based project showcasing clean, modern coding practices and some core backend features, intended as a portfolio example rather than a full production product.

## 🎯 Purpose / Overview

This project is built to demonstrate:  
- How to generate PDF documents on demand,  
- How to send emails with generated PDFs attached,  
- How to log and track visits/actions across different pages or parts of the site (visit log),  

All implemented with cleaner, refactored, up-to-date Laravel code — to show my progress in backend development and code quality.  

## ✅ Key Features

- **PDF generation on demand** — dynamically create PDF files based on user or system actions.  
- **Email sending with attachments** — send the generated PDF via email using structured email templates.  
- **Visit log (activity log / visit tracking)** — record detailed logs of visits/actions from different pages, useful for monitoring or analytics.  
- **Refactored, maintainable code structure** — organized project layout, separation of concerns, modern Laravel conventions.  

## 🚀 How to Use / Considerations

> ⚠️ This repository is provided as a **showcase / demonstration / proof of concept** — it may not include full production-ready configuration or data seeding — but it illustrates how to integrate the above features with Laravel.

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nagham-barhoum/transport-website.git
   cd transport-website

Install dependencies:

composer install

Use the relevant routes or controllers to trigger PDF generation, email sending, or visit logging.

⚠️ Note — Project State

This project is not intended as a fully deployable application. Its main goal is to show code quality, architecture, and feature implementation (PDF generation, email + attachment, visit logging) — not to serve a production-ready website.
